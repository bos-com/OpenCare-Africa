- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Include detailed steps to reproduce the bug
- Provide environment information (OS, Python version, Django version)
- Include error logs and screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Use the GitHub issue tracker with the "enhancement" label
- Describe the problem and proposed solution
- Consider the impact on existing functionality
- Think about backward compatibility

### Code Contributions

- Bug fixes
- New features
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Test coverage improvements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git
- PostgreSQL (for production-like development)
- Redis (for caching and Celery)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/OpenCare-Africa.git
   cd OpenCare-Africa
   ```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your local settings
   ```

5. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the coding standards below
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

Use conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add patient search functionality"
git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication issue in API"
git commit -m "docs: update API documentation"
git commit -m "test: add unit tests for patient model"
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### 4. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/amazing-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear description of changes
- Link to related issues
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Test results

## Code Standards

### Python/Django Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Django Best Practices

- Use Django ORM efficiently
- Implement proper model relationships
- Use Django forms and serializers
- Follow Django security best practices
- Implement proper error handling

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with Black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 .

# Run security checks with bandit
bandit -r .

# Run tests with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test apps.patients

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
coverage html  # Generate HTML report
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use factories for test data (factory-boy)

### Test Structure

```python
class PatientModelTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up test data."""
        self.patient = PatientFactory()
    
    def test_patient_creation(self):
        """Test that patient can be created."""
        self.assertIsNotNone(self.patient)
        self.assertEqual(self.patient.first_name, "John")
    
    def test_patient_full_name(self):
        """Test patient full name method."""
        expected = f"{self.patient.first_name} {self.patient.last_name}"
        self.assertEqual(self.patient.get_full_name(), expected)
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Write clear docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use Google or NumPy docstring format
- Include examples for complex functions
- Document parameters, return values, and exceptions

### API Documentation

- Update API documentation when endpoints change
- Include request/response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Provide clear error messages

### User Documentation

- Update README.md for major changes
- Maintain setup and deployment guides
- Document configuration options
- Provide troubleshooting guides

## Security

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Follow OWASP security guidelines

### Reporting Security Issues
